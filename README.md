# Advanced Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning
Summarization project in the course "Advanced Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning" - Fall 2022, ITU

### Create and install a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Replication of data processing
To replicate the our training and test data run the following notebook (adv_nlp/data_preprocessing_with_tests.ipynb) and upload the data to you google drive 


# Replicate Model finetuning and evaluations
In order to finetune the models run the following notebooks on google colab.
